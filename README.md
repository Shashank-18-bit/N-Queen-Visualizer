# N-Queen-Visualizer

The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle that involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard, such that no two queens attack each other. 
In other words, no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Features

Interactive Chessboard: The web application offers an interactive chessboard interface where users can visualize the placement of queens and the progress of the algorithm in real-time.

User Input: Users can input the desired board size (N) to experiment with the N-Queens problem on a custom-sized chessboard.

Algorithm Animation: The visualization includes an algorithm animation, enabling users to see how the N-Queens problem is solved using a backtracking or any other applicable algorithm.

Solution Highlighting: The application highlights the valid placements of queens on the board, making it easy for users to identify the safe positions.
